Advent of Code 2024 ðŸŽ„

Welcome to my Advent of Code 2024 project! This repository showcases my journey through the Advent of Code challenges, a series of daily programming puzzles designed to test problem-solving and coding skills.

As a junior programmer, I see this as an opportunity to sharpen my skills, experiment with different approaches, and grow as a developer. Each day brings a new challenge, and with it, a chance to learn something new and push my limits.
Why Advent of Code?

Iâ€™m tackling these puzzles to:

    Improve my programming logic and problem-solving techniques.
    Practice and refine skills in languages like Python and JavaScript.
    Have fun while challenging myself to think creatively under constraints.

Thanks for stopping by! If youâ€™re also working on Advent of Code, Iâ€™d love to connect and exchange ideas. Letâ€™s code, learn, and celebrate the joy of problem-solving together! ðŸŽ…âœ¨

Happy coding!
